But first of all, let's introduce what SIoTRx is.\r\n\r\nSIoTRx is a proccedural mapping language based on the Freemarker language. Freemarker is a templating engine used to inject data into an HTML document. Moreover, it can be used to generate other types of files, including RDF or Json-LD among others. Extending this language with providers, handlers and actions makes SIoTRx a powerful knowledge graph generation tool.\r\n\r\n## Theory\r\n\r\nThe ***assign*** label is used to create new variables, or replace an existing one. The way to use it is: <#assign name=value>, where *name* is the name of the variable and *value* the value to store. It can also be used like this: <#assign name>value<\/#assign>, however, *value* will always be considered as a string.\r\n\r\nFor example, to store a String in a variable and print its value  we can use the next code block.\r\n```\r\n<#assign name1=\"value1\">\r\n[=name1]\r\n```\r\n## Hands-on\r\n### Task\r\n In this case, create a variable with the value \"Hello world!\" and print it.",
    "user_template": "<#assign variable=>\n[=]",
    "solution_template": "<#assign variable=\"Hello world!\">\n[=variable]",
    "expected_result": "Hello world!"
